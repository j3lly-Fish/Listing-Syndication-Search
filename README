Instructions for building and launching locally, in your terminal (Instruction for Bash but could work in your terminal too...) :

mkdir LLS

cd LLS

Git clone https://github.com/j3lly-Fish/listing-syndication-search.git

python -m venv LLS ##May have to adjust this based on your python/pip version.

source LLS/bin/activate ##Now you'll have a nice virtual environment to install your requirements.

pip install flask
pip install jsonify
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4

cd to the LLS directory ## ./LLS there should be an app.py file in that directory. 

FLASK_APP=app.py flask run ##Run that command in LLS directory. 

cd to search-app/src

npm start

If all went well you should have a react app open in your browser at localhost:3000.
